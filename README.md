# Overview
This project is an upgrade of a web crawler from single-threaded to multi-threaded.

# What I have learned
1. More coding practice with design patterns including factory model and dependency injection.
2. How to implement a multi-threaded web crawler that counts and sorts popular words from websites.
3. How to synchronized shared data structures to detect and avoid revisiting already seen URLs.
4. How to implement concurrency with Java ForkJoinPool to speed up running time.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the instructor of the course, Dustin Hellstern from Udacity, for his concise and clear tutorial for the module - Advanced Java Programming Techniques of the course.
